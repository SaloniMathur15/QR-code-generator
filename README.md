QR Code Generator (Python)


QR Code Generator (Python)QR Code Generator (Python)
Python QR Code Generator is an application that creates QR Code for a particular string or URL. In this application, the user will have an entry field to enter the URL or the string and a QR Code will be generated accordingly and will be saved in the system.

In this project, I created a QR Code Generator using Python. For creating the GUI of the project we are going to use the Tkinter Module and its inbuilt function. For creating a QR Code we are going to use the pyqrcode Library.
I created a GUI Window that will have an entry field to enter the string or the URL and the QR Code will be generated for this entered string.

Following are the steps to create the Python QR Code Generator Project:-
1.) Importing the Required Libraries and Modules

2.) Creating the GUI Window

3.) Creating the QR Code Generator function

4.) Create Button and Entry Field
